## How does it work
There are about **4,800 adjectives and 80,000 nouns** in English vocabulary. Combine that with a **date range from year 0 to year 9999 (3,652,424 days)**. And what you get is **1,402,530,816,000,000 possible combinations** and even more if a person choses not to use standard english vocabulary.
There's no check for vocabulary, so the two words can be any word type. But adjective and noun can be easily memorized. 

> Argon2 my beloved

And here enter Argon2. Argon2 was build with configurable parameters, so we can define algorithm's time cost, which stretches calculation time to roughly **15+ seconds per hash** on modern CPUs. So to go through all standard combinations, you would have to spend **21,037,962,240,000,000 seconds** or **44,473,960 years** to generate all the standard wallet combinations.
