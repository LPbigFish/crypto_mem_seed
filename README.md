## How does it work

> Argon2 my beloved

There are about 4,800 adjectives and 80,000 nouns in English vocabulary. Combine that with a date range from year 0 to year 9999 (3,652,424 days). And what you get is **1,402,530,816,000,000 possible combinations** and even more if a person choses not to use standard english vocabulary. And here enter the Argon2. With Argon2's parameters, we can define algorithm's time cost, which stretches calculation time to 15+ seconds on modern CPUs. So to go through all standard combinations, you would have to spend **21,037,962,240,000,000 seconds or 44,473,960 years** calculating to generate all the wallets.
