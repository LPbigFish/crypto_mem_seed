# Memorable Bitcoin Wallet
A tool that breaks every rule and aspect of safe private key creation, bringing it to two words and one date.

## Website:

## Supported coins
- Bitcoin (BTC)
- Litecoin (LTC)
- Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
- Dogecoin (DOGE)
- Monero (XMR)


## How does it work
There are about **4,800 adjectives and 80,000 nouns** in the English vocabulary. Combine that with a **date range from year 0 to year 9999 (3,652,424 days)**. And what you get is **1,402,530,816,000,000 possible combinations** and even more if a person chooses not to use standard English vocabulary.
There's no check for vocabulary, so the two words can be any word type. But the adjective and noun can be easily memorized. 

> Argon2, my beloved

And here enters Argon2. Argon2 was built with configurable parameters, so we can define the algorithm's time cost, which stretches calculation time to roughly **15+ seconds per hash** on modern CPUs. So to go through all standard combinations, you would have to spend **21,037,962,240,000,000 seconds** or **44,473,960 years** to generate all the standard wallet combinations.


## Warning

No information is being leaked or stored anywhere. The entire system is fully client-side with source available on github and in your browser. But still, generating wallets using this tool is a big security risk and involves a possibility of private key being compromised by a weak choice of parameters. Use at your own risk.
